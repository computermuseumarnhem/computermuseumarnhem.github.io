## Model 43 Teleprinter KSR (Keyboard Send Receive)

This is the successor of the very popular model 33 ASR (also called ASR33). Unlike the fully mechanical model 33, this machine has a fully electronic control system, with a dot-matrix print head. It also looks more like a modern typewriter.

Options are: 
- Pinfeed or friction feed.
- Built-in telephone modem or an RS-232 serial port.
- Optionally a auxillary RS-232 port.


## Model 43 TSR (Tape Send Receive)

This device is a stand alone paper tape reader/puncher, that can be attached to a dual-interface KSR, or can be used stand-alone.

The 1981 list price of the TSR is 1330,00 (US $).
